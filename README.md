*Chromatic Selection* is a simple technique that enables handling multi-value fitness functions with a single-objective evolutionary optimizer. It is problem independent, it requires no parameter tuning, and it can be used as a drop-in replacement for both parent and survival selections (DOI: [10.1007/978-3-319-16549-3_55](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-16549-3_55)).
