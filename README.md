Chromatic Selection
===================

**Chromatic Selection** is a simple technique that enables handling multi-value fitness functions with a single-objective evolutionary optimizer. It is problem independent, it requires no parameter tuning, and it can be used as a drop-in replacement for both parent and survival selections. For more details, read the paper *Chromatic Selection - an Oversimplified Approach to Multi-Objective Optimization* by G. Squillero ([DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-16549-3_55](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-16549-3_55)), published in *EvoNUM 2015* (part of [EvoSTAR](http://www.evostar.org/2015/)).
